        some olives, chopped parsley, some feta, fried eggplant, hummus swirled with harissa, rice or rice pilaf</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lemons, juiced</li>
            <li>½ cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oi</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, peeled, smashed and minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon turmeric</li>
            <li>A pinch ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>Red pepper flakes, to taste</li>
            <li>2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 large red onion, peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare a marinade for the chicken.</li>
            <li>Combine the lemon juice, ½ cup olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, turmeric, cinnamon and red pepper flakes in a large bowl, then whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken and toss well to coat.</li>
            <li>Cover and store in refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.</li>
            <li>When ready to cook, heat oven to 425 degrees.</li>
            <li>Use the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to grease a rimmed sheet pan.</li>
            <li>Add the quartered onion to the chicken and marinade, and toss once to combine.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken and onion from the marinade, and place on the pan, spreading everything evenly across it.</li>
            <li>Put the chicken in the oven and roast until it is browned, crisp at the edges and cooked through, about 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, allow to rest 2 minutes, then slice into bits. </li>
            <li>(Optional): To make the chicken even more crisp, set a large pan over high heat, add a tablespoon of olive oil to the pan, then the sliced chicken, and sauté until everything curls tight in the heat. </li>
            <li>Scatter the parsley over the top and serve with tomatoes, cucumbers, pita, white sauce, hot sauce, olives, fried eggplant, feta, rice — really anything you desire.</li>
        </ol>
